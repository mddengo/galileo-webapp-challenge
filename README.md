# README
This is the repository for the take home project for Galileo.

In the web app, users should be able to search through existing providers and select a provider to add to the page. Selecting the provider will also display all the tasks associated with the provider, sorted by priority from high to low (highest priority is 1, next is 2, and so on).

I am most comfortable using Javascript in web development. In an effort to challenge myself and gain some bonus points (as outlined in the project specifications), I decided to use Typescript to write this; as a result, proper Typescript coding/styling conventions may not be properly displayed in the code.
